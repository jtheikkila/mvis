Lecture examples for the Machine Vision course ([521466S](https://moodle.oulu.fi/course/view.php?id=4317)).

## Installation

You may use Anaconda or pip to install the packages. 

Tested with Python version 3.8.5.

A virtual environment is recommended. 

To run the Jupyter notebooks you need the following packages:

- jupyter
- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv-python (tested with version 4.4.0.46)
- opencv-contrib-python (tested with version 4.4.0.46)
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn

## Pyrender

In two notebooks, you also need [Pyrender](https://pyrender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for image rendering. The packet can be installed with ``pip install pyrender==0.1.39`` (GPU is required).

## Image data

Data files located in folders ``3Dmodels``,``data``,``images``,``models`` and ``videos`` are needed to run the notebooks. Most of the sample images are from the [OpenCV repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/data). Files can be provided by the instructor on request.
