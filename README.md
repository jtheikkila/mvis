Lecture examples for the Machine Vision course ([521466S](https://moodle.oulu.fi/course/info.php?id=1198)).

## Installation

You may use Anaconda or pip to install the packages. 

Python version >= 3.4.9 is required.

A virtual environment is recommended. 

To run the Jupyter notebooks you need the following packages:

- jupyter
- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv-python (version 3.4.2.16)
- opencv-contrib-python (version 3.4.2.16)
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Pyrender

In two notebooks, you also need [Pyrender](https://pyrender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for image rendering. The packet can be installed with ``pip install pyrender==0.1.32`` on a GPU-enabled computer.

## Image data

Most of the sample images are from the [OpenCV repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/data). Some images are proprietary and can be provided by the instructor on request.
